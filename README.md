HTML dashboards for Chrome's Replace New Tab Page extension

Just save to a local directory, download the Chrome extension below, and point it to your HTML file. 

This uses Bootstrap for all the styling, so if there are other colors you want for some reason you can apply styles like (btn-info, btn-warning, btn-danger, btn-default instead of just btn-primary).
